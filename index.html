			<p>This is no fairy tale. No dragons, knightly sword fights or grandiose
				castles up on the hill. And yet, the stories I am about to tell you are
				no less epic. They talk about love, hope and anger, the power of
				friendships, and the marvellous things that happen when people unite,
				gathered by the conviction that together, even through small gestures,
				they can make a change, they can make their voices and other‚Äôs a bit
				louder. They are the stories of some participants of the <em>Women in
				Print Movement</em>, told through their voices, and the traces they left
				in archives.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>‚ÄúA product of <u>Second Wave feminism</u>, the Women in Print
					Movement was an attempt by a group of allied practitioners to create an
					alternative communications circuit‚Äîa woman-centered network of readers
					and writers, editors, printers, publishers, distributors, and retailers
					through which ideas, objects, and practices flowed in a continuous and
					dynamic loop. The movement‚Äôs largest goals were nothing short of
					revolutionary: it aimed to capture women‚Äôs experiences and insights in
					durable‚Äîeven beautiful‚Äîprinted forms through a communications network
					free from patriarchal and capitalist control. By doing so, participants
					believed they would not only create a space of freedom for women, but
					would also and ultimately change the dominant world outside that space.‚Äù
				<sub>(Travis, 2008, p.276)</sub></p>
					</blockquote>
					 
					
					 <p>I told you it was going to be epic. But before jumping into our
						stories, let‚Äôs take a few steps back, and consider how such a
						revolutionary movement came into being.</p>

						<p>Publishing is a political force. &#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">Barbara Greier, founder of Naiad Press puts forward the
							power and political implications of the publication: ‚ÄúWe actually
							influence people‚Äôs lives because we do infect their minds with what we
							put on the printed page. And that‚Äôs extremely important. That is really
							the most important political tool I think there is.‚Äù (Young, 1997, as
							cited in Huisman, 2016)</span>
						The publication holds potentials to foster, amplify and spread ideas, and by unfolding in the
						world, to inform, influence, criticise, persuade, manipulate.
						Conversely, it holds the power to exclude, erase and marginalise.
						Historically associated with the printed form, its accessibility is thus
						connected to the one of tools for production and diffusion:
						‚ÄúFreedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own
						one‚Äù <sub>(attributed to Liebling, 1990 as cited D≈ºu≈Çaj, 2020, sec.
						Cases: Provo and Raddraier)</sub>. Those who own one, are also often ‚Äúthose in
						traditional positions of power [who] use those tools to engineer and
						control our defining narratives‚Äù <sub>(Soulellis, 2021a, sec. Intro)</sub>, a
						privileged few who hold a monopoly, serving dominant discourses and
						maintaining power dynamics, determining‚Äîin a pre-internet era‚Äîwhat was
						(and maybe more importantly what was not) published, excluding
						minorities and dissident perspectives <sub>(Huisman, 2016, p.4)</sub>. This
						motivated the creation of alternative and independent publishing
						practices, to spread ideas and information outside of state,
						institutional or religious control, but also outside of a restrictive
						mainstream industry. A mode of publishing characterised by its sense of
						urgency; responding to the absolute necessity to record, recount and
						inform in the present <sub>(Soulellis, 2021a, sec. Intro)</sub>.</p> 
						<p>Alternative presses have played a significant role in major
						historical events like the French and American revolutions, or the
						clandestine communication networks of former communist countries, by
						facilitating the dissemination of influential ideas and information
						through self-publishing. Take Thomas Paine‚Äôs anonymously published
						pamphlet, <em>Common Sense</em>, an ‚Äúunderground bestseller‚Äù <sub>(Ludovico,
						2012, pp.32)</sub> with hundreds of thousands of copies put in circulation
						which provided the intellectual spark that ignited the uprising during
						the American Revolution.</p> 
						<p>The history of alternative presses in intimately tied with the one of
						the evolution technologies, a relationship remarkably detailed in
						Alessandro Ludovico‚Äôs book <em>Post-digital Print</em>, particularly in
						a chapter titled <em>A history of alternative publishing reflecting the
						evolution of print</em>, from which the following examples are
						extracted. To overcome the lack of means and access to mass production
						tools, alternative presses proved to be masters of diversion and
						repurposing, from the utilization wood-block printing in pre-Gutenberg
						times (<u>Biblia Pauperum</u>), to the use of manual reproduction
						techniques (such as the typewriter or small hand presses, see
						<u>samizdat</u>), or of tools initially intended for offices or
						administrations (such as the <u>mimeograph</u>,
						or later on Xerox photocopiers and <u>Risograph</u> printers). Alternative presses reached
						a peak in the 1960s, with the surge of various underground movements
						paralleled by the increasing affordability of printing techniques such
						as screen printing or small offset presses <sub>(Furter, 2017, p.22)</sub>.</p>
						<p>Now, let‚Äôs get back to our stories. What later became known as the
						<em>Women in Print Movement</em> forms part of this lineage. Being a
						group marginalised by traditional publishing, women had to come up with
						a variety of strategies to jump over the fences of this gatekept
						industry. Many women writers have, for instance, used male or
						gender-neutral pen names to overcome gender-based discrimination and
						biases prevailing in the literary world, to have their work taken more
						seriously and published.
						&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">Publishing under a male or gender-neutral name allowed
							these women writers to be judged solely on the quality of their writing,
							rather than being discriminated against based on their gender.
							Particularly common in the 19th century, it also allowed them to write
							about topics that were then considered inappropriate for women, such as
							politics, sexuality, and social issues. A few famous examples are the
							Bronte sisters/Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, Amantine Lucile Aurore
							Dupin/George Sand, Mary Ann Evans/George Eliott, Louisa May Alcott/A.M.
							Barnard, Violet Paget/Veron Lee, Alice Mary Norton/Andre Norton, Karen
							Blixen/ Isak Dinesen, Alice Sheldon/James Tiptree Jr, or more recently
							Meg Howrey and Christina Lynch/Magnus Flyte. Penguin publisher issued in
							2020 a collection called ‚ÄòReclaim Her Name‚Äô, gathering texts from
							influential pen-named women in literature. </span>

						A stratagem that has proven to be
						effective, but which circumvent the gate more than it strives to
						dismantle it. For that, it will take the strong currents of second wave
						feminism, pushing women to create their own communications channels. At
						the end of the 1960‚Äôs women‚Äôs periodicals, printers, publishing houses
						and bookstores flourished. Women took control of the production and
						distribution means, gaining autonomy at each step of the publishing
						process, from the production of content to its distribution. It allowed
						them to disseminate independently information and cultural productions
						related to the women‚Äôs movement, while re-imagining relations,
						organization, and work outside of a patriarchal and capitalist
						framework,&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">In <em>Rolling Our Own: Women as Printers, Publishers
							and Distributors,</em> Eileen Cadman, Gail Chester and Agn√®s Pivot
							underline how ‚ÄúFeminist publishing, more than any other aspect of the
							book production process, seems to epitomise most clearly the problems
							and choices which face feminists confronted with a society which is both
							patriarchal and capitalistic, in order to go about the business of
							disseminating feminist ideas.‚Äù (Cadman et al., 1981 as cited in Jolly,
							2020)</span>
						 in pursuit of a more inclusive and
						sustainable model <sub>(Travis, 2008, p.278)</sub>. A variety of approaches,
						organizational systems, demands and conceptions of feminism were carried
						and tested by its participants, making the movement a heterogenous and
						organic blob of ideas and practices rather than a homogenous
						single-voiced block <sub>(van Vught, 2020, p.30)</sub>.</p>
						<p>But if our protagonists are all very different characters, with very
							different stories, what connects them is the abnegation, boundless
							energy, unconditional love and care they put in activities that, they
							firmly believed (well, okay, with some surfacing doubts, despondency,
							and existential crises, they are still human after all), could change
							the world in which they live for the better. And even had they failed;
							at least they would have tried, at least they would have showed that
							something else is possible, at least they would not have been alone
							anymore, at least they would have found something on the way. Because
							initiating a fight against a way scarier and powerful beast than your
							typical fairy tale‚Äôs dragons‚Äîthe ruthless <em><u>matrix of
							domination</u></em> (capitalism-colonialism-heteropatriarchy-white
							supremacy)<sub>(Collins, 1990)</sub> ‚Äîcomes with its share of obstacles,
							disenchantments, and difficulties. A task all the more daunting for
							women who were simultaneously confronted with <u>intersecting</u>
							<sub>(Crenshaw, 1989, pp.57‚Äì80)</sub> axes of this matrix, and who had to fight for
							the recognition of their identities, ideas, and practices even within
							the feminist movement <sub>(Huisman, 2016, p.3)</sub>.</p>
							<p>And yet, many of those remarkable stories remained in the shadows,
							obscured by the same conditions that brought them into being. If they
							have been the subject of a growing interest for the past few years, they
							are still widely under-studied and under-narrated <sub>(Travis, 2008; Van
							Vught, 2020)</sub>, a precious legacy sleeping in a few people‚Äôs memories and
							archival boxes. Some never even made it there: ‚Äúthe matrix of domination
							produces particular burdens and privileges that determine who gets to
							succeed. As well as who doesn‚Äôt‚Äîwho isn‚Äôt included, who isn‚Äôt collected
							in the archive, who is not written into history‚Äù <sub>(Soulellis, 2021b)</sub>.
							What is made available in archives is a selection, a sample usually not
							representative of the full scope of movements and stories, but rather of
							the dynamics of domination shaping histor(y)ies.&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">What is made available in archives is a selection, a
								sample usually not representative of the full scope of movements and
								history. In this respect, there are two key parameters to consider.
								First, Feminist and social archives rely mostly on personal donations.
								For the <em>Women in Print Movement</em>, the collections often consist
								of personal archives donated by individuals and organizations who
								participated in the movement. A wide range of reasons may lead
								participants to keep their archives, such as the emotional or personal
								aspect of its content. The good preservation of the material is another
								factor, since a large part of the production consisted of ephemera
								(printed materials of ephemeral nature, such as newsletters, journals,
								or pamphlets) which were particularly fragile as they had an
								instantaneous vocation, the question of their archiving coming decades
								later. Second, archives are institutions with collection policies,
								including specific selection criteria regarding what get in and what
								does not. These policies are sometimes explicit, but often opaque, as it
								is the case for many online archives. As Paul Soulellis‚Äô quote suggests,
								these policies often reproduce (even unconsciously) intersecting
								dynamics of domination represented in Patricia Collins‚Äô <em>matrix of
								domination</em> (1990). The question of what is missing is
								still partly unanswered, and hopefully future research and donations
								will enable a more accurate and complete picture of the movement.</span></p>
							<p>As a woman navigating the art and design world and education, as a
							designer interested in editorial and publishing practices, these stories
							greatly helped me to situate myself and find agency in a discipline
							where I don‚Äôt feel I belong, but also to imagine how the tools of design
							and publishing can serve more equal, emancipatory, and sustainable
							prospects. They feel urgent to recount and reactivate in a contemporary
							context¬≠‚Äîwhich unfortunately has not rid itself of the dynamics of
							dominance mentioned before‚Äîand in the outlook of a future that promises
							to be no less rich in crises and challenges.</p>
							<p>To ensure that these stories are not lost to future researchers,
							designers, book lovers, this is an attempt to shed some light on a few
							of them and on the people who laboriously try to stich back a few pieces
							of this patchworked History to start constituting a more inclusive
							<u>book Herstory</u>. The little square I aim to bring to this patchwork
							will focus on the <em>Women in Print Movement</em> in the Netherlands, &#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">The choice to focus on the Dutch scene is mainly
								practical; to have access to primary sources, to be able to contact and
								exchange with people who were involved in the <em>Women in Print
								Movement</em>, but also and to restrict the scope of this research,
								since time and word count were limited.</span> through stories that have been
							shared by some of its participants, and the endeavours of researchers
							and designers who also work on their little squares.</p>
							<p>I thank them all for their time, generosity, and enthusiasm. Rymke
							Wiersma, Weia Reinboud, and Pamela Pattynama, for sharing their stories,
							intimately connected to the ones of their lives, with all the emotional

							for being such an inspiring designer and researcher, who warmly and
							caringly shared many resources, ideas, encouragements, and long
							conversations with me. Inge Frank van Vught, for their fantastic
							research on Atalanta and the <em>Women in Print Movement</em> in the
							Netherlands <sub>(Van Vught, 2020)</sub> without which this thesis could not
							exist, and to have discussed openly and at length the doubts,
							difficulties, joys that comes with such a work. Susana Caravalho, for

				<p>Pamela Pattynama lives in a house with a lot of stairs, and a lot of
					books. She showed me a few of them; the ones she, and her friends, made
					during the seventies and eighties. She smiles softly as her fingers
					flick the pages, and her face lightens up when she talks about them.
					<em>It was very exciting times; I am happy to have participated in
					that.</em> She was part of the publishing house De Bonte Was for a short
					period, participated in the creation of the feminist bookshop Xantippe
					in Amsterdam, worked as an editor for the magazine Lover for several
					years, and, it seems, hung out for long hours at caf√© Saarein. We talked
					about the power of writing, friendships, community-making, and a dreamt
					island where women could re-imagine their world.</p>
					<p>Writing had always been a part of Pamela‚Äôs life, long before any of
					this began. Through her words, she clarifies her thoughts, finds
					herself, finds her place in the world. <em>Writing is political, but
					it‚Äôs also very personal and emotional. It has always been my way to be
					active.</em> To write is to not be alone anymore, to recognise oneself
					and others, in all that connects and differentiates us. Writing, sharing
					experiences becomes a way to build common grounds and to understand the
					multi-faceted nature of women‚Äôs lives. <em>For me, and for other women
					generally, I think writing allows you to be more self-confident, you get
					a better self-esteem and gain insight into the roles people play, the
					ones women play towards and against each other.</em> But finding the
					time, support, space, and agency to write constitutes a first and major
					obstacle for women to publish and spread their words. Not everyone has
					‚Äúmoney and a room of their own;&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">In <em>A Room of One‚Äôs Own,</em> an essay derived from
						two lectures Woolf gave in 1928 at Newnham and Girton College (both
						women‚Äôs colleges at the University of Cambridge), she addresses the
						condition of women‚Äîmore particularly of women artists ‚Äî whose creativity
						and free expression have been repressed by centuries of financial and
						educational prejudice; as illustrates her now famous sentence: ‚Äúa woman
						must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.‚Äù
						(Woolf, 1935, p.5)</span>
					Gloria Anzald√∫a, in <em>Speaking in Tongues: A Letter to Third World
					Women Writer</em>, calls on the ‚Äúmujeres de color, companions in
					writing‚Äù <sub>(Anzald√∫a, 1983, p.165)</sub> to not wait for it
					to start writing:</p>
					<blockquote>
					<p>‚ÄúForget the room of one‚Äôs own¬≠‚Äîwrite in the kitchen, lock yourself up
					in the bathroom. Write on the bus or the welfare line, on the job or
					during meals, between sleeping or waking. I write while sitting on the
					john. No long stretches at the typewriter unless you‚Äôre wealthy or have
					a patron‚Äîyou may not even own a typewriter. While you wash the floor or
					clothes listen to the words chanting in your body. When you‚Äôre
					depressed, angry, hurt, when compassion and love possess you. When you
					cannot help but write.‚Äù&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">(Anzald√∫a, 1983, p.170) This beautiful
						quotation was shared by Loraine Furter, who came across it during her
						own research.</span></p> 
					</blockquote>
					<p>A sense of urgency which led some women to unite their forces to push
					the walls and create their room of one‚Äôs own themselves.&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">Collectivity‚Äîmaking together‚Äîwas crucial in the women in
						print movement, including in the production of content. Various books,
						pamphlets, newspapers and articles were written collectively, sometimes
						under a unique signature. In the series of books published by De Bonte
						Was‚Äîeven if based on individual experiences‚Äîthe texts are written using
						the plural ‚Äúwe‚Äù, emphasizing the commonalities in women‚Äôs struggle. It
						also allowed women with varying writing experience to work together and
						strengthen each other‚Äôs individual voices. In an advertisement issued in
						various feminist periodicals, the Groningen literary magazine Belletrien
						(published by VIDA), encourages women to start writing ‚ÄúWomen have
						always written. Women write. Women will continue to write. Pick up the
						pen.‚Äù Another striking instance of collective writing is the series of
						‚Äúlesbian pulp novels‚Äù titled <em>Wilden Rosen</em>, written together by
						the four women of the Groningen based Damesschrijfbrigade Dorcas in
						1979.
						(Van Vught, 2020, pp.42-43; [Advertisement for Belletrien, magazine
						of literature], n.d)</span>
					This need to write inspired a group of eight feminists to create, under
					the impetus of Anneke van Baalen, Annemarie Behrens, Akke van der Meer
					and Greet Vooren <sub>(Ekelschot, 2005, sec. De Bonte Was)</sub> the
					publishing house De Bonte Was, at the end of the 1970‚Äôs. <em>Actually,
					no, in the beginning [of the 1970‚Äôs]. I am really bad with dates
					(laughs)</em>. They settled in the attic of the Amsterdam Vrouwenhuis,
					where they invited others to write about their experiences as
					housewives, mothers, lovers, women. A series of five small books emerged
					from this experiment. Short texts, deliberately written in a clear and
					understandable way, in which women were encouraged to express themselves
					openly.</p>
					<blockquote>
					<p>‚ÄúThat was liberating for them, but also for the readers. The books
					were a huge success. This was evident from the sales, but also from the
					hundreds of registrations for the discussion weekends to which we
					invited the readers. Women came from all over the country to talk about
					the content of the books and their own lives, and thus break through the
					suffocation of isolation and self-hatred.‚Äù&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">The weekends were held on March 15th and 16th and April
						19th and 20th, 1975. Translation mine. (Ekelschot, 2005, sec. De Bonte
						Was)</span></p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>What they represented, their mere existence, was radical and new.
					<em>At that time, it felt urgent for women to speak out and talk from a
					personal level. It was not only political in a general way, but it was
					also very individual, private as well. (‚Ä¶) Before that, women as a
					collective, it didn‚Äôt exist, we were isolated from each other‚Äôs. So, it
					was radical at the time to talk about our experiences, and from there
					imagine all sort of actions and initiatives. We had women‚Äôs weekends,
					which soon became lesbian weekends. That was radical too, because
					lesbians didn‚Äôt have any kind of collective group or joined action
					either.</em></p>

					<p>In publishing, feminists gradually took control of the means of
					production and distribution, creating autonomous and semi-autonomous
					networks <sub>(Huisman, 2016).</sub> In 1975, Pamela, with four other
					women (Annemarie Behrens, Carla Br√ºnott, Cris van der Hoek, and Sjuul
					Tegelaar) founded Xantippe, the second women‚Äôs bookshop in the
					Netherlands <sub>(<em>Archief Xantippe Vrouwenboekwinkel 1975-1997</em>
					[Geschiedenis], n.d.)</sub>. Their aim was to promote radical feminism
					through the diffusion of books and magazines; <em>we couldn‚Äôt find any
					collection of women‚Äôs books. There were, of course, women authors, but
					they were scrambled between a lot of male authors. And there were no
					feminist books in the traditional bookshops. So, we made our own!</em>
					In June 1976, after many discussions regarding the selection of books
					Xantippe would offer, the bookshop finally opened its doors at its first
					address: Westerstraat 193, Amsterdam. They sold their own books, like
					Sjuul, who distributed her absurdist, photocopied, <em>very funny
					booklets, with all sorts of drawings</em>, but also publications from
					other feminist initiatives, as well as international literature. Some of
					them were produced within the feminist circles, others using the
					mainstream production and diffusion networks. <em>There were a lot of
					discussions about how to be as autonomous as we could, and at the same
					time, how can we make use of them</em> [the mainstream production and
					publication networks]<em>? There were feminist printers and publishers,
					but a lot of the books were made in conventional, capitalist publishing
					houses. The international books for instance came mainly via the
					traditional channels.</em> This mixed approach would evolve through
					time, with the movement gaining momentum and demand increasing. ‚ÄúThe
					first two books [published by De Bonte Was] were typed and mimeographed.
					Later, we reprinted and produced the books with an offset printer. From
					1977 we also outsourced the typesetting, and a few years later the
					distribution.‚Äù <sub>(Ekelschot, 2005, sec. De Bonte Was, Translation
					mine)</sub></p>
					<p>Xantippe was run by a small collective of volunteers, and each person
					worked one day a week<em>. I did the Tuesday. Sometimes, the bookshop
					was closed because no one was there to open, ‚ÄòYeah, sorry, I drank too
					much last night‚Äô. Some of us were very strict and some of us way less
					(laughs).</em> Money quickly became one of the central topics of
					discussion. <em>Some women wanted to be paid. And some were radically
					against payments, because that made you a capitalist.</em> These
					discussions were not confined to the bookshop, and were shared in many
					other initiatives. The absence of commercial interests allowed for a
					certain freedom, as each decision could be made for ideological rather
					than economic reasons.¬†‚ÄúWe worked at De Bonte Was voluntarily, in order
					to have the freedom to publish what we wanted and not what the market
					was waiting for. A pleasant consequence of this was that the books were
					cheap, so women who had less money could buy them too‚Äù <sub>(Ekelschot,
					2005, sec. De Bonte Was, Translation mine)</sub>. Proceeds were usually
					used to buy equipment, books, materials or to rent facilities.&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">It is to be noted that most feminist initiatives were
						relying on squatting, a practice less common since the Dutch squatting
						ban of 2010.</span> Women had to earn money elsewhere,
					some of them were working odd jobs, but most relied on governmental
					subsidies.&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">‚ÄúThe age range at De Bonte Was was between 19 and 60. We
						all earned money quite differently: as a midwife, police officer,
						divorced woman with six children, scientific assistant, student, etc.‚Äù
						(Ekelschot, 2005, De Bonte Was). Many participants of the movement were
						students and received governmental grants. Other women had unemployment
						benefits or were working in various sectors. The quasi-absence of
						financial compensation for activities that were extremely
						labour-intensive also meant that some women could not engage in such
						work for monetary reasons.<br>
						Almost all the archives I consulted from printers, publishers and
						periodicals included subsidies applications, to both public and private
						organisations. Some initiatives however, like Atalanta, were reluctant
						to request them, for ideological reasons and to preserve complete
						freedom of creation ‚ÄúApplying for a subsidy was not really something
						that was considered by anarcha-feminists; no way, we liked to stay out
						of the grip of the government, using our benefits as a basic income. (‚Ä¶)
						We consciously choose to work without subsidy, i.e. without concessions,
						without control from outside.‚Äù (Van Vught, pp.61-62)<br>
						These reflections are shared by other feminists, as evidenced by the
						creation in 1983 of Mama Cash, the ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs first international,
						independent women‚Äôs finance fund‚Äù, imagined by Marjan Sax, Dorelies
						Kraakman, Tania Leon, Patti Slegers and Lida van den Broek, it aimed to
						‚Äúlaunch innovative activities and to support initiatives that the
						government would not‚Äù. (<em>Archief Mama Cash 1982-2002</em>
						[Geschiedenis]<em>,</em> n.d.)</span></p>
					<p>Various feminist initiatives and organizations were blossoming,
					creating a revolutionary and diverse landscape. The desire to create a
					space of freedom for themselves, but also to challenge the dominant
					dynamics outside of it was a powerful driving force of the movement
					<sub>(Travis, 2008, p.276)</sub>. <em>What gave us power is the will to
					change the society, our situation, the way people look at us. It was a
					very ambitious strive to change, which was inseparable from the social
					situation and political situation.</em> Informed by other
					socio-political movements, such as the gay, Black, anti-fascist or
					anti-authoritarian movements, the feminist movement, far from being as
					linear and uniform as the image of the wave may suggest, is in fact
					characterised by its multivocality, and the variety of groups and ideas
					expressed within them <sub>(Van Vught, 2020, p.17)</sub>. <em>We knew
					each other‚Äôs, sometimes we were friends, sometimes we had meetings
					together. They were often very chaotic, those meetings. We all had
					different aims, and different conceptions and ideas about how the
					movement should go on, or what action was necessary.</em> Those
					discussions, as difficult as they could get, also allowed to challenge
					the dominance of some group of women within the movement. Critiques of a
					mostly white, heterosexual, secular feminism were brought about by
					various groups of Black, lesbian, working class, migrant and refugee
					women <sub>(Huisman, 2016, p.3)</sub>. Sexism started to be understood
					as intertwined with race, sexuality, class and religion, and women who
					were not represented in the movement organised themselves to create
					their own practices and initiatives <sub>(De¬†Vries, 2016)</sub>. <em>The
					Black women had their own groups, and I was in a white group. I‚Äôm mixed,
					my parents come from Indonesia, but my foremothers and fathers were
					either white, Asian or Black. When the Black women began their groups
					and their actions, it was an eye-opener for me. It made me think about
					myself, my ethnicity, my upbringing and what was the difference between
					me and my white friends. I‚Äôm really grateful for those early Black
					feminists. (‚Ä¶) Lesbian women also initiated discussions about our place
					in the feminist movement, as the talks and actions were always against
					men, or about marriage, having children and so on. So we made a separate
					group, and we called ourselves feminist radical lesbians.</em></p>

					<p>De Bonte Was was considered to be a radical feminist publishing
					house. Many initiatives in the movement qualified themselves as such
					(radical feminist), so much so that tracing the contours of what this
					term encompasses becomes an exercise in funambulism. <em>For me, radical
					feminism is like feminism should be. Very critical, but also very
					self-reflexive, on the gender roles, power dynamics, on the way women
					were treated, and on the incorporation of various norms and codes.</em>
					Often, groups who defined themselves as radical feminist were also
					separatist. This strand of feminism, stemming from lesbian feminist
					ideologies, advocated for the necessity¬≠¬≠‚Äîuntil heteropatriarchy was
					overthrown‚Äîfor women to separate themselves from men in women-only
					enclaves <sub>(Travis, 2008, p.278)</sub>. A withdrawal that would allow
					them to break free from the heteropatriarchal and capitalist logics that
					were imposed on them within institutions, relationships, and activities
					in favour of a more sustainable and supportive women‚Äôs culture. Feminist
					separatism has been a principle widely applied in the <em>Women in Print
					Movement</em>, that majorly consisted in women-only structures who
					collaborated, supported each other, and shared tools or spaces <sub>(Van
					Vught, 2020)</sub>. <em>They excluded men, from their actions, their
					initiatives, and from their lives. It was very critical too, and some
					women found it too much. (laughs).</em></p>
					<p>These women‚Äôs enclaves, and the movement more generally, also sprung
					from the friendships, romances, and diverse relationships that its
					participants entertained with each other. A bond whereby women were able
					to build common grounds, through which they could support each other and
					find a sense of togetherness. <em>In the first place it was friendships,
					joy and pleasure, from which those initiatives arose. We were a band of
					women who were friendly with each other, sometimes more than friendly.
					(‚Ä¶)</em> <em>It was important to be able to be together. We could speak
					out the frustration and recognise that other women felt the same.</em>
					The feminist calendar was punctuated by parties, drinks, festivals,
					workshops, collective readings, and various meetings in caf√©s and
					vrouwenhuizen, which assisted in developing and promoting a women‚Äôs
					culture whilst cementing an expanding network. The various sites became
					spaces for encounters, exchanges, and celebrations, for community and
					kin-making. <em>The parties, the meetings and the discussion nights,
					however difficult, were very important, even essential, to create a
					sense of collectiveness.</em></p>
			
					<p>More than the creation and maintenance of a network, it was also its
					expansion, both locally and internationally, that these relationships
					catalysed. Foreign texts from contemporary and historical authors were
					translated,&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">Translation is crucial in the development of the
						<em>Women in Print Movement</em>. Translating historical as well as
						contemporary feminist texts, mostly from the United States, contributed
						to the formation of a historical and more global bibliography of the
						women‚Äôs movement. It is also eminently political, as this excerpt from
						the Women‚Äôs Translation Collective De Bron shows; ‚ÄúThe [collective]
						started in Amsterdam in 1982, as an initiative of 5 rather critical
						feminist translators, who neither liked how feminist, and especially
						lesbian texts were translated, nor the position of translators. It was
						decided that both could be radically improved by adding a new link in
						the production chain of women‚Äôs books. (‚Ä¶) The collective is specialized
						in the translation of feminist and lesbian texts. This means that we
						work primarily for: feminist publishers, women‚Äôs studies, lesbian and
						feminist action groups, selected government agencies‚Äù (Van Vught, 2019,
						p.27; [Information sheet by the Translation Collective De Bron], ca.
						1980)</span> allowing feminists to confront
					their ideas, to exchange and to keep up to date with the evolution of
					the movement at different scales <sub>(Travis, 2008)</sub>. <em>We had
					some connections with women from Germany, England, the United-States and
					from France. One of my friends was in a partnership with Monique Wittig
					for a while. So we went to France and met other feminists, and later
					they came here. It was funny, they were very separationist. They wanted
					to have an island, a women‚Äôs island, where they wouldn‚Äôt have any
					interactions with men. Once, we went on a weekend to discuss it.
					Everyone was very excited, and we talked about it through the night. But
					in the morning, everyone was desperate, because it turned out that we
					all had a good reason to not go to the island just yet, ‚Äòyes, I want the
					island, but not yet because I have a girlfriend‚Äô or ‚ÄòActually, no, maybe
					later, I can‚Äôt leave my mother‚Äô. My reason was that I didn‚Äôt want to
					share my books (laughs).</em></p>

Muchachas</p></figcaption></figure>
					
					<p>The thought exercise that the island represents, though fictional,
					though idealised, is akin to what they attempted within their lives and
					practices. How do we imagine a new world outside of heteropatriarchy?
					How do we live our relationships, how do we create and maintain
					communities, how do we create together? A variety of responses and paths
					emerged. Many structures operated in non-hierarchical ways, the voices
					of every participant, no matter their level of education or involvement
					in the initiative, counted as much as the others. <em>We always tried to
					be ‚Äòdemocratic‚Äô. At LOVER, all the decisions were made together, and we
					talked until everybody was on the same line.</em> Tasks were distributed
					among the women, who all worked in turn at different positions to
					prevent forms of dominance and hierarchy from appearing <sub>(Furter,
					2017, p.26).</sub> ‚ÄúWithin De Bonte Was we shared intellectual and
					manual labour as fairly as possible: thinking and writing were expected
					of everyone, but mimeographing, packing, answering letters, visiting
					book fairs, giving interviews, etc., as well‚Äù <sub>(Ekelschot, 2005,
					sec. De Bonte Was, translation mine.)</sub>. The signatures are often
					collective, insisting on the collaborative aspect of the movement‚Äôs
					productions¬≠‚Äîturning away from the traditional patterns of creation and
					notion of authorship <sub>(Furter, 2017, p.3)</sub>. This also acted as
					a protection, as some women wished to publish anonymously.

                  print movement, including in the production of content. Various books,
                  pamphlets, newspapers and articles were written collectively, sometimes
                  under a unique signature. In the series of books published by De Bonte
                  Was‚Äîeven if based on individual experiences‚Äîthe texts are written using
                  the plural ‚Äúwe‚Äù, emphasizing the commonalities in women‚Äôs struggle. It
                  also allowed women with varying writing experience to work together and
                  strengthen each other‚Äôs individual voices. In an advertisement issued in
                  various feminist periodicals, the Groningen literary magazine Belletrien
                  (published by VIDA), encourages women to start writing ‚ÄúWomen have
                  always written. Women write. Women will continue to write. Pick up the
                  pen.‚Äù Another striking instance of collective writing is the series of
                  ‚Äúlesbian pulp novels‚Äù titled <em>Wilden Rosen</em>, written together by
                  the four women of the Groningen based Damesschrijfbrigade Dorcas in
                  1979. (Van Vught, 2020, pp.42-43; [Advertisement for Belletrien, magazine

               <span class="sidenote-mobile"><sup>12</sup>It is to be noted that most feminist initiatives were
                  relying on squatting, a practice less common since the Dutch squatting

               <span class="sidenote-mobile"><sup>13</sup>‚ÄúThe age range at De Bonte Was was between 19 and 60. We
                  all earned money quite differently: as a midwife, police officer,

                  (Ekelschot, 2005, De Bonte Was). Many participants of the movement were
                  students and received governmental grants. Other women had unemployment
                  benefits or were working in various sectors. The quasi-absence of
                  financial compensation for activities that were extremely
                  labour-intensive also meant that some women could not engage in such
                  work for monetary reasons.<br>Almost all the archives I consulted from printers, publishers and
                  periodicals included subsidies applications, to both public and private
                  organisations. Some initiatives however, like Atalanta, were reluctant
                  to request them, for ideological reasons and to preserve complete
                  freedom of creation ‚ÄúApplying for a subsidy was not really something
                  that was considered by anarcha-feminists; no way, we liked to stay out
                  of the grip of the government, using our benefits as a basic income. (‚Ä¶)

                  without control from outside.‚Äù (Van Vught, pp.61-62)<br>
                  These reflections are shared by other feminists, as evidenced by the
                  creation in 1983 of Mama Cash, the ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs first international,
                  independent women‚Äôs finance fund‚Äù, imagined by Marjan Sax, Dorelies

               <span class="sidenote-mobile"><sup>14</sup>Translation is crucial in the development of the
                  <em>Women in Print Movement</em>. Translating historical as well as
                  contemporary feminist texts, mostly from the United States, contributed
                  to the formation of a historical and more global bibliography of the
                  women‚Äôs movement. It is also eminently political, as this excerpt from
                  the Women‚Äôs Translation Collective De Bron shows; ‚ÄúThe [collective]
                  started in Amsterdam in 1982, as an initiative of 5 rather critical
                  feminist translators, who neither liked how feminist, and especially
                  lesbian texts were translated, nor the position of translators. It was
                  decided that both could be radically improved by adding a new link in
                  the production chain of women‚Äôs books. (‚Ä¶) The collective is specialized
                  in the translation of feminist and lesbian texts. This means that we

					Weia Reinboud and Rymke Wiersma that took place on December
					14<sup>th</sup>, 2022, in Utrecht, completed by external sources and

				<p>Rymke and Weia met in the spring of 1980 and fell in the love the
					minute they saw each other. At least that is what Weia says. <em>No, you
					fell in love with me! (Rymke chuckles).</em> They stayed together ever
					since, partnering in life and in running the still active publishing
					house Atalanta. Driven by the conviction that ‚Äúthe world can be much
					nicer, thinking can be much deeper‚Äù <sub>(Reinboud &amp; Wiersma,
					n.d.),</sub> they write, print, and publish their own works. They live
					and work in an eco-neighbourhood of Utrecht, in a three-storey house
					that they share with three friends. On the ground floor, a spacious room
					that hosted their printing press for many years, is now the home of an
					office printer, Weia‚Äôs paintings and Atalanta‚Äôs archives. All the way up
					the stairs, just under the roof, a room bathed in light in which we sat
					to drink tea and talk about self-publishing, walking in the mountains,
					radical feminism, and the Dutch women‚Äôs movement.</p>

					<p>At the end of 1979, Rymke, together with three other women, had the
					idea to create a feminist printing house. None of them knew the first
					thing about printing, and so they ask Weia, who worked for the feminist
					printer Virginia, to teach them how to operate the small offset press
					bought with their savings and the proceeds of a cake sale. More than her
					expertise, she shared with the other women an enthusiasm that became
					contagious, and she joined the team in 1980. Soon after, while traveling
					in Greece, Rymke discovered the mythological heroine Atalanta, a
					headstrong, swift-footed woman who was raised by a bear on Mount
					Parthenion and devoted herself to the goddess Artemis. It is also the
					name of ‚Äúa beautiful butterfly‚Äîbut all butterflies are beautiful, of
					course, as are all woodlice!‚Äù <sub>(Reinboud &amp; Wiersma,
					2005)</sub><em>.</em> Atalanta found a name, and soon after, a place.
					The five women settled in a squatted space in Ridderhofstad, in Utrecht,
					which they spent more than a year renovating. <em>It was a great time.
					We didn‚Äôt work a lot, because there were so many discussions, so many
					things happening, in the movement and in our lives. (Rymke)</em>. They
					installed their small single-colour offset press in the centre of the
					room and painted it a dark-red colour. Everything was finally ready. But
					before they could even get to print once, the building was sold to a
					private owner. Atalanta had to move and two of the women, soon followed
					by a third, left the project for diverse personal reasons. Weia and
					Rymke took their small venture alone to a new place, a women‚Äôs building
					shared with a wood workshop and an artist space.</p>
					<p>At the end of 1982, the first projects rolled off the press. Among
					them, several prints for women‚Äôs restaurant <em>Eucalypta</em>, a
					poster, some flyers, and stickers for the lesbian festival
					<em>Pottenpracht</em>, a few posters for various women‚Äôs events, and an
					issue of the Black feminist magazine Umoja, whose members came to help
					with the printing. But the desire to print for other feminist
					initiatives was soon hindered by the quirks of their old, unreliable
					machines. The print quality was inconsistent, their darkroom consisted
					of a large curtain of black plastic weighted down by pebbles, and the
					press often had to be operated by hand with a crank made of copper water
					pipes, making commissioned work difficult and stressful. After some
					time, they focused mainly on their own productions. <em>I think we were
					very critical too, so we worked only with a few people</em> <em>(Rymke,
					laughing). Also, I always wanted to write, and I thought that having our
					own print shop, I could print and publish my texts too</em>. They could
					then adapt their designs to the whims of their machines, spend less time
					repairing them, and devoted themselves more fully to writing, which was
					taking up more and more of their time. In their texts, they developed a
					radical and feminist philosophy, intertwined with their anarchist,
					ecologist, and vegan convictions. This approach makes them difficult to
					place in bookshops: <em>When we went to the Women‚Äôs Bookshop and showed
					our newest things they said ‚ÄòWell, that's more for the leftist
					Bookshop‚Äô, and when we went to the leftist bookshops they said ‚ÄòWell,
					that's more for the ecological bookshop‚Äô etc. (Weia).</em></p>

					<p>Being able to produce and publish their content autonomously, without
					the influence of others, has always been and remains central in
					Atalanta‚Äôs practice. It is more generally a driving force of the
					<em>Women in Print Movement</em>. Many publications would not have seen
					the light of day otherwise, as funds were lacking to afford big print
					runs in mainstream printing houses, which were already quite reluctant
					to print feminist publications discussing topics such as sex, women‚Äôs
					health, abortion, lesbianism, and feminist politics. <sub>(Huisman,
					2016, p.4)</sub> Learning the technical and practical skills was
					therefore essential, not only to preserve autonomy, but also to follow
					the second wave feminist idea ‚Äúthat the simultaneous development of
					women‚Äôs heads and hands was necessary to prevent a divisive split
					between radical theory and practice. Without a conscious blurring of the
					lines between manual and mental labour, feminists risked recreating
					among themselves the hierarchies of class, intellect, power, and so
					forth, that they were committed to eradicating‚Äù <sub>(Travis, 2008,
					p.280)</sub>. Just like Weia, many women were already working in the
					printing trade before joining the movement, in which they shared their
					knowledges and skills with other women who could, in turn, handle
					printing and production. &#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">‚ÄúWe already have the Vrouwenkranten, feminist monthly
						magazines, feminist publishers (De Bonte Was and Sara), and women‚Äôs
						bookstores, but the technical production was until now in the hands of
						men.‚Äù (Baart, 1978, as cited in Van Vught, 2020) This changes with the
						creation of the Vrouwendrukkerij Virginia in 1978, probably the first
						and largest women‚Äôs printer in the Netherlands. Virginia printed books
						and advertisement for Sara and De Bonte Was, and miscellaneous printed
						objects for various vrouwenhuizen [women house], caf√© Saarein,
						restaurant Orka la rose, periodical Serpentine, bookstore Xantippe, and
						diverse feminist events. The following years will witness the emergence
						of a multitude of printers throughout the country, including: Per Zet
						(Haarlem, ?), De Kloof (Amsterdam, ?), De Dwarse Prinses (Amsterdam,
						1981?), Oma Druck (Nijmegen, 1981?), Sidonia (Groningen, 1981), De
						Doordrukster (Den Bosch, 1982), Las Muchachas (Amsterdam, 1982), De
						Ziedende Zeef (Nijmegen, 1982?), De Brandweervrouw (Amsterdam, 1982),
						Iris (Culembourg, 1983?). Mainly or exclusively producing printed
						materials for the women‚Äôs movement, printing houses also served an
						emancipatory function. Women who experienced gender discrimination in
						their studies as well as the professional printing world find a place to
						learn, share knowledge, and practice their craft in a supportive
						environment.</p>
						<p>The spread of this expertise
					resulted in the creation of ‚Äúboth a revolutionary women‚Äôs culture‚Äîone
					that made all women theorizers of gender‚Äîand a revolutionary print
					culture‚Äîone that undid the specialization and professionalization that
					had characterized printing and publishing since the early modern
					period.‚Äù <sub>(Travis, 2008, p.281)</sub></p>
					<p>It is also this crossroad of thought that led Atalanta to invent
					their own modes of creation. <em>Doing everything ourselves, it followed
					this anarchist idea to always do things your own way (Weia)</em>. They
					paid particular attention to reducing the environmental impact of their
					production, by using recycled materials and veganizing the printing
					process. &#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">Offset printing is a printing technique in which a
						rubber cylinder transfers an inked image from a printing plate (usually
						made of aluminum or zinc) onto paper. The film used to expose the plates
						commonly contained gelatin, a product derived from animal collagen.</span> Their ideologies resonated in the
					designs as well, to which they attached great importance. <em>Once, we
					were at a fair, and a man came to our stand, looked at the books, and
					said: ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt like any of your topics, but your books are beautiful!‚Äô.
					Another very decent gentleman was leafing through De Egeltjes. He put it
					down, picked it up again and bought it. Shy and proud at the same time,
					he told us: ‚ÄòI have never bought anything anarchist before‚Äô</em>
					<em>(Weia).</em></p>

					<p>(Almost) everything was made by their four hands, collaborating on
					the illustrations, hand-drawing letters for the covers, refining them on
					the computer, stitching or stappling freshly printed booklets. &#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">The design of the <em>Women in Print Movement</em>‚Äôs
						productions varies greatly from one initiative to another, but also over
						time. In the early days of the movement, many publications were produced
						urgently, on a small scale and with few resources‚Äîall of which
						influenced their design. They were reproduced in a manual or semi-manual
						ways, and were often typeset, sometimes consisting of a simple stack of
						stapled sheets, other time in bound or stapled booklets. Mostly printed
						in black, colour could be incorporated through a second ink, or with
						coloured paper. The design and production work were often done in-house,
						and frequently included manual addition‚Äîillustrations, dividers,
						lettering. As the movement grew, some publications were produced on a
						larger scale, became thicker, some covers became hardback and the manual
						additions and small drawings slowly disappeared, making way for images,
						in some cases printed in full colour.</span> Weia even created their own
					typeface, named Atalanta, a revival of a Nicolas Jenson font dating from
					1470. Months of work, scrunched back over the small screen of their
					newly acquired Atari computer were necessary to finish the typeface,
					adding some roman capitals as well as an anarchist sign to the
					renaissance lowercases. Although she studied type design briefly, she
					mostly learned by herself. Typography was (and remains) an extremely
					exclusive, normative field, dominated by (white, heterosexual) men, and
					from which women were largely excluded, or restricted to certain
					positions. A few women managed to infiltrate this small world, using
					particular strategies, like Beatrice Warde who joined American Type
					Founders as a specialised librarian, and published her first research
					paper in 1927 in Le Fleuron under the pseudonym Paul Beaujon.
					<sub>(Furter, 2020)</sub> A rarity, until the advent of early digital
					technologies that allowed women, like Weia, to enter this field through
					a back door.&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">See the great article <em>Crystal Clear</em>, written by
						Loraine Furter, about this topic: ‚ÄúSince many established type designers
						have been slow to embrace or even hostile towards these new technologies
						of making fonts, women finally have the opportunity to enter the field
						of type design, and simultaneously become pioneers. The most famous
						designers of this time are Susan Kare, type, and icon designer for the
						first Apple Macintosh, Carol Twombly, who co-designed the font Myriad,
						Virginia Howlett, designer of the font Verdana, Zuzana Licko, co-founder
						of one of the first independent digital type foundry named Emigre and

						landscapes‚Äô at MIT‚Äôs Media Lab she founded in 1975.‚Äù<br>

					<p>Atalanta multiplied media, produce(d) music, videos, games,
					postcards, t-shirts. So many forms which carry and spread their message
					in different ways and in different places. &#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">This thesis focuses on publishing, but the printed
						material found in the archives testifies to the variety and richness of
						the movement‚Äôs cultural productions. Theatre, music and film festivals,
						radio broadcasts, and numerous exhibitions were organized by various
						groups and initiatives.</span>
					This diversification of formats, and the breaking away from the
					book-object, was found in many productions of the <em>Women in Print
					Movement</em>. The different actions and demonstrations saw a multitude
					of banners, t-shirts, posters, buttons, but also bodies shouting loudly
					what they think, their anger, their messages. Challenging the
					traditional format of the publication, these urgent artefacts, although
					more ephemeral, still constituted ways of publishing; they made public
					and disseminated ideas. They established in a radical way new narratives
					and disrupted those in place, in their form as in their discourse.</p>
					<p>To this day, Rymke and Weia, are still busy crafting and sharing
					these disruptive stories, their ideas for a better world. Except for
					Wednesdays, their day off, which is dedicated to long walks and
					observing birds. Their story is quite unique within the History of
					movement. Its longevity, the diversity of their activities, media, and
					subjects of writing, the intertwinement of radical feminism with other
					currents of thought‚Äîveganism, anarchism, anti-racism‚Äîthe scale, which
					remained deliberately small, allowing them to do everything themselves
					as much as possible, from the creation of the content, to the design,
					printing, production and distribution of the books are as many
					particularities that make it stand out.</p>

                  larger scale, became thicker, some covers became hardback and the manual
                  additions and small drawings slowly disappeared, making way for images,
                  in some cases printed in full colour.

				<div class="title chapter-4"><h1>The Researcher, the Designer & the Archive</h1> <h2></h2></div>

				<p>Why am I telling you these stories? And maybe more interestingly, why
					am I telling them in this particular way? The idea of the interviews
					initially emerged from being confronted with the sheer volume of the
					archive. Having found relatively little theoretical resources about the
					movement and its development in the Netherlands, I expected this to be
					echoed in the amount of archival material. I was surprised to discover
					an overflowing, dense, and complex archive, in which I would soon drown,
					unable to make a choice, to decide to focus on this or that initiative.
					A lush, yet incomplete, unruly mass that is defined as much by what it
					gathers as what it excludes.&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">See note n¬∞4 about the Archive.</span></p>
					<p>The archive was therefore no longer just a place that provided access to
					sources, but in turn a subject, an actor in the research, allowing a
					better understanding of how stories are shaped, but also forgotten and
					marginalised. Chandra Frank, in a recent article on her findings on the
					transnational feminist lesbian exchanges between the Dutch collective
					Sister Outsider and Audre Lorde that took place in 1984 and 1986,
					reflects on the traces of this event in the Archive for the Women‚Äôs
					Movement (IAV), hosted at Atria in Amsterdam, and in the Spelman College
					Archives in Atlanta, Georgia. Comparing how they came into being and
					have evolved, she underlines how archives‚Äîas a sites of knowledge
					production‚Äîare informed and structured by violent mechanism of
					exclusion, not only through the selection of material made available,
					but also through its organization and systematization‚Äîhow material can
					(or cannot) be found: ‚Äú[f]or example, within the IAV Collection there
					are similar collectives and publications that were all part of the BMR
					[Black, Migrant, Refugee] movement and are either coded as &lt;black
					women&gt; or &lt;black women‚Äôs movement&gt;; yet these two terms signify
					a different historiography when constructing a genealogy of the BMR
					movement.‚Äù&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">‚ÄúThe [IAV] collection has historically been
						white-focused, which led early BMR archivists of colour such as Cisca
						Pattipilohy and Troetje Loewenthal to develop a strong critique of the
						racialised institutional memory practices of white archival
						institutions. This eventually inspired the start of Flamboyant, the
						first national documentation and research centre for BMR women, where
						Sister Outsider was known to organise too. The critiques by BMR women
						were directly related to the way that white institutions would engage,
						code, catalogue and make available materials that pertain to racialised
						feminist and queer histories. The earlier critiques, voiced on the
						accessibility of materials, still resonate today as the lack of
						specialised knowledge on the BMR movement informs how materials can be
						found at Atria. For example, within the IAV Collection there are similar
						collectives and publications that were all part of the BMR movement and
						are either coded as &lt;black women&gt; or &lt;black women‚Äôs
						movement&gt;; yet these two terms signify a different historiography
						when constructing a genealogy of the BMR movement. The first term
						indicates that the archival materials will be about Black women, while
						the second suggests that the materials in this particular record are
						part of a broader movement. These different coding systems make it
						impossible to have an understanding of the scope of materials that are
						related to the BMR movement in the IAV Collection.‚Äù<br />
						(Frank, 2019, p.16)</span></p>
					<p>She argues that the use and re-activation of those archival materials
					does more than just activate specific stories‚Äîit becomes the embodiment
					of the refusal to be part of a ‚Äúforgotten archive‚Äù <sub>(Frank, 2019,
					p.12)</sub>, an embodied practice of memory.</p>
					<blockquote>
					<p>‚ÄúI am invested in both addressing the complexities of conducting
					archival research and, inspired by Clare Hemmings (2011), asking why
					these stories matter. (‚Ä¶) I argue that a transnational feminist archival
					methodology that is rooted in a practice of ‚Äòorientation‚Äô (Ahmed, 2006a,
					2006b), ‚Äòlistening‚Äô (Campt, 2017) and ‚Äòintervention‚Äô (Appadurai, 2003)
					is best placed to analyse the political solidarity forged between Sister
					Outsider and Audre Lorde. I take this approach to ask larger questions
					of how feminist and queer stories are told when contending with the
					complexities and unruliness of archives. Hemmings (2011) urges feminist
					scholars to take into consideration how narratives are constructed.
					Similar to and beyond the academic institution that Hemmings locates as
					a primary stakeholder in this process, the archive greatly impacts how
					stories and their afterlives are reckoned with.‚Äù <sub>(Frank, 2019,
					p.12)</sub></p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>It thus appeared important to take a step aside, one foot in the
					personal and the other in the institutional, in order to examine it
					better, to make a shift to not to work <em>on</em> the archive, but
					rather <em>with it</em>. <em>Listening</em>, encountering, exchanging,
					as ways to re-activate and put in perspective archival materials
					appeared to me as the best suited way to conduct this study.&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">These exchanges also proved necessary with regard to the
						personal and emotional nature of some archival material. A matter which
						was discussed at length with Inge Frank van Vught, in a conversation
						about the difficulties of working with such sensitive content, as some
						of the participants of the movement do not want to see it republished or
						shared, and about conducting research on the stories of people with whom
						relations of friendships and trust are developed.</span> Pamela (Pattynama), at the end of
					our interview, told me about two young feminists‚ÄîMarie Lotte Hagen and
					Nydia van Voorthuizen‚Äîwho invited Netty van Hoorn&#8239;<label class="sidenote-number"></label> <span class="sidenote">Netty Van Hoorn is a Dutch director. In 2019, she

					<sub>(Hagen &amp; Van Voorthuizen, 2020)</sub> The hosts were deeply

					unfamiliar with the history and actions of the radical feminist and
					lesbian movements. The voices, stories, individual experiences, and
					collections of the participants of the movement are indispensable to
					make accessible and stitch back the bits and pieces of a fragmented
					historiography. The episode became one of the most popular of the
					podcast, largely listened to by young women, thus demonstrating the
					significance of transgenerational exchanges in the process reclaiming
					and rewriting herstories that have been confiscated for too long. By
					establishing connections between different timelines, they also allow

					<p>‚ÄúRe-vision, the act of looking back, of seeing with fresh eyes, of

					<p>Thus, digitalization does not (by itself) necessarily guarantee
					broader or fairer accessibility to content, but also to publishing tools
					and dissemination platforms. The last decades have seen the emergence of
					new, hybrid or digital publication formats which redefine both the
					traditional conception of the publication‚Äî ‚Äúallow[ing] for forms which
					were long de-considered and rejected from legitimate writing and history
					to be finally included‚Äù <sub>(Furter, 2017, p.3)</sub>, and its
					accessibility. However,</p>
					<blockquote>
					<p>‚Äúdespite this wider access, some conditions (economic means,
					education, censorship) make that many voices still cannot express
					themselves. And again, when they can, there still must be someone to
					listen to them. The attention that is due to these new forms of
					publication, and the value that is associated aren‚Äôt spread in an equal
					way. A blog, as accessible as it can seem, needs to be relayed to be
					actually read, and, even if one can today use commoned software tools,
					it needs maintenance. Through social media platforms, we have more than
					ever access to the button ‚Äúpublish‚Äù, but we don‚Äôt necessarily have
					control over the mechanisms and conditions in which it happens.
					Publishing is a question of distribution, not only in its potential (a
					stock of books, a pdf ready to be printed on demand, a website pushed
					online...) but also in its actual reception by a public.‚Äù <sub>(Furter,
					2017, p.3)</sub></p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Striving for more inclusive and sustainable publishing practices
					therefore also means to facilitate and critically reflect on, as
					designers, not only the access to contents, but also to tools and
					platforms.</p> <p></p>

				<p>‚ÄúMapping a feminist landscape can never be complete.‚Äù<sub>(Noorani
					&amp; Nixdorff, n.d.)</sub> In this thesis, I recounted two stories of
					feminist publishing, but many others are still sleeping in the archives,
					and some never made it there. A compromised accessibility that results
					from intersecting forms of discrimination, unjustly erasing some
					histories, positing them in the realm of the forgotten¬≠‚Äîthe marginalised.
					Finding them requires archaeological skills‚Äîscratching the surface of
					the institutional, digging in the archive but also outside of it, to
					uncover the untold stories hidden between the lines, confined in attics
					or memories. They call for specific, hybrid methodologies, centring
					around practices of listening, exchanging, and encountering, and by
					connecting individuals, generations, and timelines, enabling the
					rewriting and reclaiming of long-lost stories, as well as building
					legacies and common grounds for future feminist efforts.</p>
					<p>Feminist stories of publishing constitute a rich reservoir of ideas
					and practices; dismantling traditional hierarchies and notions of
					authorship, emphasizing the importance of collectivity, skill-sharing,
					kin-making and autonomy, as well as creating independent networks of
					solidarity, production and distribution.</p>
					<p>As many proposals it feels urgent to revive in a contemporary
					context, where access to publishing tools and platforms has been
					transformed by the emergence of digital technologies but remain widely
					unequal. They provide a basis to reflect upon how the designer can
					catalyse the emancipatory potentials of publishing, by facilitating the
					access to contents, tools, and platforms, in the pursuit of more
					sustainable and inclusive practices.</p>

				<h2>Biblia pauperum</h2>
				<p>Biblia pauperum, a Latin term for ‚Äúpauper‚Äôs Bible‚Äù‚ÄîBible of the poor‚Äî
				refers to block books created in medieval Europe, typically in the 14th
				and 15th centuries, which visualized the correspondences between the Old
				and New Testaments. They consisted mainly of a series of illustrations,
				often accompanied by short explanatory texts written in vernacular
				languages. This popular format, that could be compared to contemporary
				comics, was used by the minor clergy as a visual help for prayers and
				reflections. <sub>(‚ÄúBiblia Pauperum.,‚Äù n.d.)</sub></p>
				<h2>Book History</h2>
				<p>Book history is an interdisciplinary field of study at the crossroad
				of textual scholarship, codicology, bibliography, philology,
				palaeography, art history, social history and cultural history, that
				began to be recognized as an academic discipline in the 1980s.<br>
				A pioneering scholar of this field is Robert Darnton, an American
				historian who wrote extensively on the history of books and reading in
				France and Europe during the modern era, and defined his discipline as
				‚Äúthe social and cultural history of communication by print‚Äù. In his
				essay <em>What is the History of Books</em>? (1982), he develops a model
				that will become foundational within the field, a ‚Äúcommunication
				circuit‚Äù comprising six links forming a dynamic loop; author - publisher
				‚Äì printer ‚Äì shipper ‚Äì seller ‚Äì reader. By considering the full scope of
				this circuit, he encourages scholars to examine the book as an object
				and a cultural artifact, by analyzing both its material aspects and its
				social, economical and cultural significance in a transnational context.
				<sub>(Davidjgary, 2013)</sub></p>
				<h2>Edit-a-thon</h2>
				<p>An edit-a-thon (or ‚Äúeditathon‚Äù) is an event, or a series of events,
				during which people work together‚Äîonline or in person‚Äîto edit, improve,
				expand, or create wiki entries. They can be organized in very structured
				or very informal ways, around a wide range of themes and topics‚Äîwomen‚Äôs
				history, environmental issues, vernacular cultures and histories‚Äîand
				generally about subjects that are underrepresented on the platform.
				<sub>(<em>Edit-a-thon</em>, 2022)</sub></p>
				<h2>Herstory</h2>
				<p>Herstory [from <em>her</em> + <em>story</em>] is a term coined by
				U.-S. feminist activists during the 1970s, to designate a version of
				history written from a feminist perspective, often with a focus on the
				experiences, contributions and achievement of women, which are usually
				overlooked in traditional historical accounts. Herstory is thus
				contrasted with history, which although derived from the Greek and Latin
				<em>historia</em>, and not the contraction of <em>his</em> +
				<em>story</em>, is inherently male-centered. <sub>(Colman,
				2008)</sub></p>
				<h2>Intersectionnality</h2>
				<p>‚ÄúThe term ‚Äòintersectionality‚Äô has its roots in Black feminist
				activism, and was originally coined by American critical legal race
				scholar Kimberl√© Williams Crenshaw in 1989. Crenshaw used the term
				intersectionality to refer to the double discrimination of racism and
				sexism faced by Black women, critiquing the ‚Äòsingle-axis framework that
				is dominant in antidiscrimination law.. feminist theory and anti-racist
				politics‚Äô for its focus on the experiences of the most privileged
				members of subordinate groups. (‚Ä¶)<br>
				Crenshaw provided the following definition of intersectionality:
				‚ÄòIntersectionality is a metaphor for understanding the ways that
				multiple forms of inequality or disadvantage sometimes compound
				themselves and create obstacles that often are not understood among
				conventional ways of thinking.‚Äô‚Äù <sub>(‚ÄúUsing Intersectionality to
				Understand Structural Inequality in Scotland: Evidence Synthesis‚Äù,
				2022)</sub></p>
				<h2>Matrix of domination</h2>
				<p>The matrix of domination, resonating with Kimberl√© Crenshaw‚Äôs concept
				of intersectionality, is coined by Patricia Collins in <em>Black
				Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of
				Empowerment</em> (1990), to show how societal power relations are
				organized by four interconnected domains (structural, hegemonic,
				disciplinary and interpersonal domains). She thus explains how
				capitalism, white supremacy and heteropatriarchy are interlocking
				systems of oppression, which are experienced simultaneously by the
				individuals who exist at their intersections, connecting (among other),
				race, gender, class, sexuality or religion. <sub>(Collins, 1990 ;
				Costanza-Chock, 2008)</sub></p>
				<h2>Mimeograph</h2>
				<p>‚ÄúA mimeograph, also called stencil duplicator, was a printing machine
				used in the mid-20th century to produce copies of documents or images.
				It worked by using a stencil, which was placed on a rotating drum, to
				transfer ink onto paper. The machine was manually operated, with the
				operator cranking the drum to create the copies. Mimeographs were
				commonly used in schools and businesses before modern photocopiers
				became widely available.‚Äù <sub>(‚ÄúMimeograph | printing technology‚Äù,
				n.d.)</sub></p>
				<h2>Risograph</h2>
				<p>The Risograph (or riso-duplicator), is a low-cost, high-volume and
				high-speed printer. Released in Japan in 1980 by the Riso Kagaku
				Corporation, it was initially intended for offices, schools, churches
				and political parties, and will later know a resurgence in activist and
				artistic circles, due to its affordability, as well as its bold and
				textured colours. The underlying technology is close to the mimeograph,
				and uses a digitally produced stencil, through which ink is pushed.
				<sub>(<em>What Is a Risograph?</em>, n.d.)</sub></p>
				<h2>Samizdat</h2>
				<p>‚ÄúSamizdat, (from Russian <em>sam</em>, ‚Äúself,‚Äù and
				<em>izdatelstvo</em>, ‚Äúpublishing‚Äù), literature secretly written,
				copied, and circulated in the former Soviet Union and usually critical
				of practices of the Soviet government. (‚Ä¶) Samizdat publications
				expanded their focus beyond freedom of expression to a critique
				of many aspects of official Soviet policies and activities, including
				ideologies, culture, law, economic policy, historiography, and treatment
				of religions and ethnic minorities. Because of the government‚Äôs strict
				monopoly on presses, photocopiers, and other such devices, samizdat
				publications typically took the form of carbon copies of typewritten
				sheets and were passed by hand from reader to reader.‚Äù <sub>(‚ÄúSamizdat |
				Soviet Literature,‚Äù n.d.)</sub></p>
				<h2>Second wave feminism</h2>
				<p>‚ÄúA shorthand reference for the politically active form of feminism
				that emerged in the US and elsewhere in the 1960s. It was neither a
				unified nor a homogeneous movement, but it did of course have a common
				goal, however disparately this was conceived, namely the equality of the
				sexes. It was born of the recognition that in spite of the considerable
				advances of the retrospectively christened First Wave of feminism, women
				had still not achieved genuine equality with men in every facet of life.
				Its starting point, in the US, was Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique
				(1963), which argues that women are trapped in a system that denies them
				self-identity as women and demands they find fulfilment through their
				husbands and children. Later writers, particularly those identifying as
				radical feminists, would use the term patriarchy as a shorthand for this
				systemic subordination of women at the level of culture itself, rather
				than individual men.‚Äù <sub>(‚ÄúSecond Wave Feminism,‚Äù n.d.)</sub></p>
