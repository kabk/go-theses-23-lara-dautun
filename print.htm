			<p>This is no fairy tale. No dragons, knightly sword fights or grandiose
				castles up on the hill. And yet, the stories I am about to tell you are
				no less epic. They talk about love, hope and anger, the power of
				friendships, and the marvellous things that happen when people unite,
				gathered by the conviction that together, even through small gestures,
				they can make a change, they can make their voices and other’s a bit
				louder. They are the stories of some participants of the <em>Women in
				Print Movement</em>, told through their voices, and the traces they left
				in archives.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>“A product of <u>Second Wave feminism</u>, the Women in Print
					Movement was an attempt by a group of allied practitioners to create an
					alternative communications circuit—a woman-centered network of readers
					and writers, editors, printers, publishers, distributors, and retailers
					through which ideas, objects, and practices flowed in a continuous and
					dynamic loop. The movement’s largest goals were nothing short of
					revolutionary: it aimed to capture women’s experiences and insights in
					durable—even beautiful—printed forms through a communications network
					free from patriarchal and capitalist control. By doing so, participants
					believed they would not only create a space of freedom for women, but
					would also and ultimately change the dominant world outside that space.”
				<sub>(Travis, 2008, p.276)</sub></p>
					</blockquote>
					 
					
					 <p>I told you it was going to be epic. But before jumping into our
						stories, let’s take a few steps back, and consider how such a
						revolutionary movement came into being.</p>
						<p>Publishing is a political force.<span class="appelnote"></span><span class="sidenote sidenote-first">Barbara Greier, founder of Naiad Press puts forward the
							power and political implications of the publication: “We actually
							influence people’s lives because we do infect their minds with what we
							put on the printed page. And that’s extremely important. That is really
							the most important political tool I think there is.” (Young, 1997, as
							cited in Huisman, 2016)</span>
						The publication holds potentials to foster, amplify and spread ideas, and by unfolding in the
						world, to inform, influence, criticise, persuade, manipulate.
						Conversely, it holds the power to exclude, erase and marginalise.
						Historically associated with the printed form, its accessibility is thus
						connected to the one of tools for production and diffusion:
						“Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own
						one” <sub>(attributed to Liebling, 1990 as cited Dżułaj, 2020, sec.
						Cases: Provo and Raddraier)</sub>. Those who own one, are also often “those in
						traditional positions of power [who] use those tools to engineer and
						control our defining narratives” <sub>(Soulellis, 2021a, sec. Intro)</sub>, a
						privileged few who hold a monopoly, serving dominant discourses and
						maintaining power dynamics, determining—in a pre-internet era—what was
						(and maybe more importantly what was not) published, excluding
						minorities and dissident perspectives <sub>(Huisman, 2016, p.4)</sub>. This
						motivated the creation of alternative and independent publishing
						practices, to spread ideas and information outside of state,
						institutional or religious control, but also outside of a restrictive
						mainstream industry. A mode of publishing characterised by its sense of
						urgency; responding to the absolute necessity to record, recount and
						inform in the present <sub>(Soulellis, 2021a, sec. Intro)</sub>.</p> 
						<p>Alternative presses have played a significant role in major
						historical events like the French and American revolutions, or the
						clandestine communication networks of former communist countries, by
						facilitating the dissemination of influential ideas and information
						through self-publishing. Take Thomas Paine’s anonymously published
						pamphlet, <em>Common Sense</em>, an “underground bestseller” <sub>(Ludovico,
						2012, pp.32)</sub> with hundreds of thousands of copies put in circulation
						which provided the intellectual spark that ignited the uprising during
						the American Revolution. <img class="imgSide" src="/assets/images/img-02.png"></p> 
						<p>The history of alternative presses in intimately tied with the one of
						the evolution technologies, a relationship remarkably detailed in
						Alessandro Ludovico’s book <em>Post-digital Print</em>, particularly in
						a chapter titled <em>A history of alternative publishing reflecting the
						evolution of print</em>, from which the following examples are
						extracted. To overcome the lack of means and access to mass production
						tools, alternative presses proved to be masters of diversion and
						repurposing, from the utilization wood-block printing in pre-Gutenberg
						times (<u>Biblia Pauperum</u>), to the use of manual reproduction
						techniques (such as the typewriter or small hand presses, see
						<u>samizdat</u>), or of tools initially intended for offices or
						administrations (such as the <u>mimeograph</u>, <img class="imgSide"  src="/assets/images/img-02.png">
						or later on Xerox
						photocopiers and <u>Risograph</u> printers). Alternative presses reached
						a peak in the 1960s, with the surge of various underground movements
						paralleled by the increasing affordability of printing techniques such
						as screen printing or small offset presses <sub>(Furter, 2017, p.22)</sub>.</p>
						<p>Now, let’s get back to our stories. What later became known as the
						<em>Women in Print Movement</em> forms part of this lineage. Being a
						group marginalised by traditional publishing, women had to come up with
						a variety of strategies to jump over the fences of this gatekept
						industry. Many women writers have, for instance, used male or
						gender-neutral pen names to overcome gender-based discrimination and
						biases prevailing in the literary world, to have their work taken more
						seriously and published.
						<span class="appelnote"></span><span class="sidenote">Publishing under a male or gender-neutral name allowed
							these women writers to be judged solely on the quality of their writing,
							rather than being discriminated against based on their gender.
							Particularly common in the 19th century, it also allowed them to write
							about topics that were then considered inappropriate for women, such as
							politics, sexuality, and social issues. A few famous examples are the
							Bronte sisters/Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, Amantine Lucile Aurore
							Dupin/George Sand, Mary Ann Evans/George Eliott, Louisa May Alcott/A.M.
							Barnard, Violet Paget/Veron Lee, Alice Mary Norton/Andre Norton, Karen
							Blixen/ Isak Dinesen, Alice Sheldon/James Tiptree Jr, or more recently
							Meg Howrey and Christina Lynch/Magnus Flyte. Penguin publisher issued in
							2020 a collection called ‘Reclaim Her Name’, gathering texts from
							influential pen-named women in literature.</span>
				        A stratagem that has proven to be
						effective, but which circumvent the gate more than it strives to
						dismantle it. For that, it will take the strong currents of second wave
						feminism, pushing women to create their own communications channels. At
						the end of the 1960’s women’s periodicals, printers, publishing houses
						and bookstores flourished. Women took control of the production and
						distribution means, gaining autonomy at each step of the publishing
						process, from the production of content to its distribution. It allowed
						them to disseminate independently information and cultural productions
						related to the women’s movement, while re-imagining relations,
						organization, and work outside of a patriarchal and capitalist
						framework,<span class="appelnote"></span><span class="sidenote">In <em>Rolling Our Own: Women as Printers, Publishers
							and Distributors,</em> Eileen Cadman, Gail Chester and Agnès Pivot
							underline how “Feminist publishing, more than any other aspect of the
							book production process, seems to epitomise most clearly the problems
							and choices which face feminists confronted with a society which is both
							patriarchal and capitalistic, in order to go about the business of
							disseminating feminist ideas.” (Cadman et al., 1981 as cited in Jolly,
							2020)</span>
						 in pursuit of a more inclusive and
						sustainable model <sub>(Travis, 2008, p.278)</sub>. A variety of approaches,
						organizational systems, demands and conceptions of feminism were carried
						and tested by its participants, making the movement a heterogenous and
						organic blob of ideas and practices rather than a homogenous
						single-voiced block <sub>(van Vught, 2020, p.30)</sub>.</p>
						<p>But if our protagonists are all very different characters, with very
							different stories, what connects them is the abnegation, boundless
							energy, unconditional love and care they put in activities that, they
							firmly believed (well, okay, with some surfacing doubts, despondency,
							and existential crises, they are still human after all), could change
							the world in which they live for the better. And even had they failed;
							at least they would have tried, at least they would have showed that
							something else is possible, at least they would not have been alone
							anymore, at least they would have found something on the way. Because
							initiating a fight against a way scarier and powerful beast than your
							typical fairy tale’s dragons—the ruthless <em><u>matrix of
							domination</u></em> (capitalism-colonialism-heteropatriarchy-white
							supremacy)<sub>(Collins, 1990)</sub> —comes with its share of obstacles,
							disenchantments, and difficulties. A task all the more daunting for
							women who were simultaneously confronted with <u>intersecting</u>
							<sub>(Crenshaw, 1989, pp.57–80)</sub> axes of this matrix, and who had to fight for
							the recognition of their identities, ideas, and practices even within
							the feminist movement <sub>(Huisman, 2016, p.3)</sub>.</p>
							<p>And yet, many of those remarkable stories remained in the shadows,
							obscured by the same conditions that brought them into being. If they
							have been the subject of a growing interest for the past few years, they
							are still widely under-studied and under-narrated <sub>(Travis, 2008; Van
							Vught, 2020)</sub>, a precious legacy sleeping in a few people’s memories and
							archival boxes. Some never even made it there: “the matrix of domination
							produces particular burdens and privileges that determine who gets to
							succeed. As well as who doesn’t—who isn’t included, who isn’t collected
							in the archive, who is not written into history” <sub>(Soulellis, 2021b)</sub>.
							What is made available in archives is a selection, a sample usually not
							representative of the full scope of movements and stories, but rather of
							the dynamics of domination shaping histor(y)ies.<span class="appelnote"></span><span class="sidenote">What is made available in archives is a selection, a
								sample usually not representative of the full scope of movements and
								history. In this respect, there are two key parameters to consider.
								First, Feminist and social archives rely mostly on personal donations.
								For the <em>Women in Print Movement</em>, the collections often consist
								of personal archives donated by individuals and organizations who
								participated in the movement. A wide range of reasons may lead
								participants to keep their archives, such as the emotional or personal
								aspect of its content. The good preservation of the material is another
								factor, since a large part of the production consisted of ephemera
								(printed materials of ephemeral nature, such as newsletters, journals,
								or pamphlets) which were particularly fragile as they had an
								instantaneous vocation, the question of their archiving coming decades
								later. Second, archives are institutions with collection policies,
								including specific selection criteria regarding what get in and what
								does not. These policies are sometimes explicit, but often opaque, as it
								is the case for many online archives. As Paul Soulellis’ quote suggests,
								these policies often reproduce (even unconsciously) intersecting
								dynamics of domination represented in Patricia Collins’ <em>matrix of
								domination</em> (1990). The question of what is missing is
								still partly unanswered, and hopefully future research and donations
								will enable a more accurate and complete picture of the movement.</span></p>
							<p>As a woman navigating the art and design world and education, as a
							designer interested in editorial and publishing practices, these stories
							greatly helped me to situate myself and find agency in a discipline
							where I don’t feel I belong, but also to imagine how the tools of design
							and publishing can serve more equal, emancipatory, and sustainable
							prospects. They feel urgent to recount and reactivate in a contemporary
							context­—which unfortunately has not rid itself of the dynamics of
							dominance mentioned before—and in the outlook of a future that promises
							to be no less rich in crises and challenges.</p>
							<p>To ensure that these stories are not lost to future researchers,
							designers, book lovers, this is an attempt to shed some light on a few
							of them and on the people who laboriously try to stich back a few pieces
							of this patchworked History to start constituting a more inclusive
							<u>book Herstory</u>. The little square I aim to bring to this patchwork
							will focus on the <em>Women in Print Movement</em> in the Netherlands, <span class="appelnote"></span><span class="sidenote">The choice to focus on the Dutch scene is mainly
								practical; to have access to primary sources, to be able to contact and
								exchange with people who were involved in the <em>Women in Print
								Movement</em>, but also and to restrict the scope of this research,
								since time and word count were limited.</span> through stories that have been
							shared by some of its participants, and the endeavours of researchers
							and designers who also work on their little squares.</p>
							<p>I thank them all for their time, generosity, and enthusiasm. Rymke
							Wiersma, Weia Reinboud, and Pamela Pattynama, for sharing their stories,
							intimately connected to the ones of their lives, with all the emotional
							aspects, tears, laughs and hopes that are part of it. Loraine Furter,
							for being such an inspiring designer and researcher, who warmly and
							caringly shared many resources, ideas, encouragements, and long
							conversations with me. Inge Frank van Vught, for their fantastic
							research on Atalanta and the <em>Women in Print Movement</em> in the
							Netherlands <sub>(Van Vught, 2020)</sub> without which this thesis could not
							exist, and to have discussed openly and at length the doubts,
							difficulties, joys that comes with such a work. Susana Caravalho, for
							her great reading list and feedback, which, for the first time in my
							studies, proposed a different vision of design and introduced its
							potentials for empowerment and change. The archivists at Atria<span class="appelnote"></span><span class="sidenote">Atria, institute on gender equality and women’s history,

		<div class="title"><h1>Pamela Pattynamma —</h1> <h2>Dreaming of an Island</h2></div>

		<p>Pamela Pattynama lives in a house with a lot of stairs, and a lot of
			books. She showed me a few of them; the ones she, and her friends, made
			during the seventies and eighties. She smiles softly as her fingers
			flick the pages, and her face lightens up when she talks about them.
			<em>It was very exciting times; I am happy to have participated in
			that.</em> She was part of the publishing house De Bonte Was for a short
			period, participated in the creation of the feminist bookshop Xantippe
			in Amsterdam, worked as an editor for the magazine Lover for several
			years, and, it seems, hung out for long hours at café Saarein. We talked
			about the power of writing, friendships, community-making, and a dreamt
			island where women could re-imagine their world.</p>
			<p>Writing had always been a part of Pamela’s life, long before any of
			this began. Through her words, she clarifies her thoughts, finds
			herself, finds her place in the world. <em>Writing is political, but
			it’s also very personal and emotional. It has always been my way to be
			active.</em> To write is to not be alone anymore, to recognise oneself
			and others, in all that connects and differentiates us. Writing, sharing
			experiences becomes a way to build common grounds and to understand the
			multi-faceted nature of women’s lives. <em>For me, and for other women
			generally, I think writing allows you to be more self-confident, you get
			a better self-esteem and gain insight into the roles people play, the
			ones women play towards and against each other.</em> But finding the
			time, support, space, and agency to write constitutes a first and major
			obstacle for women to publish and spread their words. Not everyone has
			“money and a room of their own<em>”</em>;<a href="#fn2"
			class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
			Gloria Anzaldúa, in <em>Speaking in Tongues: A Letter to Third World
			Women Writer</em>, calls on the “mujeres de color, companions in
			writing” <sub>(Anzaldúa, 1983, p.165)</sub> to not wait for it
			to start writing:</p>
			<blockquote>
			<p>“Forget the room of one’s own­—write in the kitchen, lock yourself up
			in the bathroom. Write on the bus or the welfare line, on the job or
			during meals, between sleeping or waking. I write while sitting on the
			john. No long stretches at the typewriter unless you’re wealthy or have
			a patron—you may not even own a typewriter. While you wash the floor or
			clothes listen to the words chanting in your body. When you’re
			depressed, angry, hurt, when compassion and love possess you. When you
			cannot help but write.”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>A sense of urgency which led some women to unite their forces to push
			the walls and create their room of one’s own themselves<a href="#fn4"
			class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.
			This need to write inspired a group of eight feminists to create, under
			the impetus of Anneke van Baalen, Annemarie Behrens, Akke van der Meer
			and Greet Vooren <sub>(Ekelschot, 2005, sec. De Bonte Was)</sub> the
			publishing house De Bonte Was, at the end of the 1970’s. <em>Actually,
			no, in the beginning [of the 1970’s]. I am really bad with dates
			(laughs)</em>. They settled in the attic of the Amsterdam Vrouwenhuis,
			where they invited others to write about their experiences as
			housewives, mothers, lovers, women. A series of five small books emerged
			from this experiment. Short texts, deliberately written in a clear and
			understandable way, in which women were encouraged to express themselves
			openly.</p>
			<blockquote>
			<p>“That was liberating for them, but also for the readers. The books
			were a huge success. This was evident from the sales, but also from the
			hundreds of registrations for the discussion weekends to which we
			invited the readers. Women came from all over the country to talk about
			the content of the books and their own lives, and thus break through the
			suffocation of isolation and self-hatred.”<a href="#fn5"
			class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>What they represented, their mere existence, was radical and new.
			<em>At that time, it felt urgent for women to speak out and talk from a
			personal level. It was not only political in a general way, but it was
			also very individual, private as well. (…) Before that, women as a
			collective, it didn’t exist, we were isolated from each other’s. So, it
			was radical at the time to talk about our experiences, and from there
			imagine all sort of actions and initiatives. We had women’s weekends,
			which soon became lesbian weekends. That was radical too, because
			lesbians didn’t have any kind of collective group or joined action
			either.</em></p>
			<p>In publishing, feminists gradually took control of the means of
			production and distribution, creating autonomous and semi-autonomous
			networks <sub>(Huisman, 2016).</sub> In 1975, Pamela, with four other
			women (Annemarie Behrens, Carla Brünott, Cris van der Hoek, and Sjuul
			Tegelaar) founded Xantippe, the second women’s bookshop in the
			Netherlands <sub>(<em>Archief Xantippe Vrouwenboekwinkel 1975-1997</em>
			[Geschiedenis], n.d.)</sub>. Their aim was to promote radical feminism
			through the diffusion of books and magazines; <em>we couldn’t find any
			collection of women’s books. There were, of course, women authors, but
			they were scrambled between a lot of male authors. And there were no
			feminist books in the traditional bookshops. So, we made our own!</em>
			In June 1976, after many discussions regarding the selection of books
			Xantippe would offer, the bookshop finally opened its doors at its first
			address: Westerstraat 193, Amsterdam. They sold their own books, like
			Sjuul, who distributed her absurdist, photocopied, <em>very funny
			booklets, with all sorts of drawings</em>, but also publications from
			other feminist initiatives, as well as international literature. Some of
			them were produced within the feminist circles, others using the
			mainstream production and diffusion networks. <em>There were a lot of
			discussions about how to be as autonomous as we could, and at the same
			time, how can we make use of them</em> [the mainstream production and
			publication networks]<em>? There were feminist printers and publishers,
			but a lot of the books were made in conventional, capitalist publishing
			houses. The international books for instance came mainly via the
			traditional channels.</em> This mixed approach would evolve through
			time, with the movement gaining momentum and demand increasing. “The
			first two books [published by De Bonte Was] were typed and mimeographed.
			Later, we reprinted and produced the books with an offset printer. From
			1977 we also outsourced the typesetting, and a few years later the
			distribution.” <sub>(Ekelschot, 2005, sec. De Bonte Was, Translation
			mine)</sub></p>
			<p>Xantippe was run by a small collective of volunteers, and each person
			worked one day a week<em>. I did the Tuesday. Sometimes, the bookshop
			was closed because no one was there to open, ‘Yeah, sorry, I drank too
			much last night’. Some of us were very strict and some of us way less
			(laughs).</em> Money quickly became one of the central topics of
			discussion. <em>Some women wanted to be paid. And some were radically
			against payments, because that made you a capitalist.</em> These
			discussions were not confined to the bookshop, and were shared in many
			other initiatives. The absence of commercial interests allowed for a
			certain freedom, as each decision could be made for ideological rather
			than economic reasons. “We worked at De Bonte Was voluntarily, in order
			to have the freedom to publish what we wanted and not what the market
			was waiting for. A pleasant consequence of this was that the books were
			cheap, so women who had less money could buy them too” <sub>(Ekelschot,
			2005, sec. De Bonte Was, Translation mine)</sub>. Proceeds were usually
			used to buy equipment, books, materials or to rent facilities<a
			href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. Women had to earn money elsewhere,
			some of them were working odd jobs, but most relied on governmental
			subsidies.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
			<p>Various feminist initiatives and organizations were blossoming,
			creating a revolutionary and diverse landscape. The desire to create a
			space of freedom for themselves, but also to challenge the dominant
			dynamics outside of it was a powerful driving force of the movement
			<sub>(Travis, 2008, p.276)</sub>. <em>What gave us power is the will to
			change the society, our situation, the way people look at us. It was a
			very ambitious strive to change, which was inseparable from the social
			situation and political situation.</em> Informed by other
			socio-political movements, such as the gay, Black, anti-fascist or
			anti-authoritarian movements, the feminist movement, far from being as
			linear and uniform as the image of the wave may suggest, is in fact
			characterised by its multivocality, and the variety of groups and ideas
			expressed within them <sub>(Van Vught, 2020, p.17)</sub>. <em>We knew
			each other’s, sometimes we were friends, sometimes we had meetings
			together. They were often very chaotic, those meetings. We all had
			different aims, and different conceptions and ideas about how the
			movement should go on, or what action was necessary.</em> Those
			discussions, as difficult as they could get, also allowed to challenge
			the dominance of some group of women within the movement. Critiques of a
			mostly white, heterosexual, secular feminism were brought about by
			various groups of Black, lesbian, working class, migrant and refugee
			women <sub>(Huisman, 2016, p.3)</sub>. Sexism started to be understood
			as intertwined with race, sexuality, class and religion, and women who
			were not represented in the movement organised themselves to create
			their own practices and initiatives <sub>(De Vries, 2016)</sub>. <em>The
			Black women had their own groups, and I was in a white group. I’m mixed,
			my parents come from Indonesia, but my foremothers and fathers were
			either white, Asian or Black. When the Black women began their groups
			and their actions, it was an eye-opener for me. It made me think about
			myself, my ethnicity, my upbringing and what was the difference between
			me and my white friends. I’m really grateful for those early Black
			feminists. (…) Lesbian women also initiated discussions about our place
			in the feminist movement, as the talks and actions were always against
			men, or about marriage, having children and so on. So we made a separate
			group, and we called ourselves feminist radical lesbians.</em></p>
			<p>De Bonte Was was considered to be a radical feminist publishing
			house. Many initiatives in the movement qualified themselves as such
			(radical feminist), so much so that tracing the contours of what this
			term encompasses becomes an exercise in funambulism. <em>For me, radical
			feminism is like feminism should be. Very critical, but also very
			self-reflexive, on the gender roles, power dynamics, on the way women
			were treated, and on the incorporation of various norms and codes.</em>
			Often, groups who defined themselves as radical feminist were also
			separatist. This strand of feminism, stemming from lesbian feminist
			ideologies, advocated for the necessity­­—until heteropatriarchy was
			overthrown—for women to separate themselves from men in women-only
			enclaves <sub>(Travis, 2008, p.278)</sub>. A withdrawal that would allow
			them to break free from the heteropatriarchal and capitalist logics that
			were imposed on them within institutions, relationships, and activities
			in favour of a more sustainable and supportive women’s culture. Feminist
			separatism has been a principle widely applied in the <em>Women in Print
			Movement</em>, that majorly consisted in women-only structures who
			collaborated, supported each other, and shared tools or spaces <sub>(Van
			Vught, 2020)</sub>. <em>They excluded men, from their actions, their
			initiatives, and from their lives. It was very critical too, and some
			women found it too much. (laughs).</em></p>
			<p>These women’s enclaves, and the movement more generally, also sprung
			from the friendships, romances, and diverse relationships that its
			participants entertained with each other. A bond whereby women were able
			to build common grounds, through which they could support each other and
			find a sense of togetherness. <em>In the first place it was friendships,
			joy and pleasure, from which those initiatives arose. We were a band of
			women who were friendly with each other, sometimes more than friendly.
			(…)</em> <em>It was important to be able to be together. We could speak
			out the frustration and recognise that other women felt the same.</em>
			The feminist calendar was punctuated by parties, drinks, festivals,
			workshops, collective readings, and various meetings in cafés and
			vrouwenhuizen, which assisted in developing and promoting a women’s
			culture whilst cementing an expanding network. The various sites became
			spaces for encounters, exchanges, and celebrations, for community and
			kin-making. <em>The parties, the meetings and the discussion nights,
			however difficult, were very important, even essential, to create a
			sense of collectiveness.</em></p>
			<p>More than the creation and maintenance of a network, it was also its
			expansion, both locally and internationally, that these relationships
			catalysed. Foreign texts from contemporary and historical authors were
			translated<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
			role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, allowing feminists to confront
			their ideas, to exchange and to keep up to date with the evolution of
			the movement at different scales <sub>(Travis, 2008)</sub>. <em>We had
			some connections with women from Germany, England, the United-States and
			from France. One of my friends was in a partnership with Monique Wittig
			for a while. So we went to France and met other feminists, and later
			they came here. It was funny, they were very separationist. They wanted
			to have an island, a women’s island, where they wouldn’t have any
			interactions with men. Once, we went on a weekend to discuss it.
			Everyone was very excited, and we talked about it through the night. But
			in the morning, everyone was desperate, because it turned out that we
			all had a good reason to not go to the island just yet, ‘yes, I want the
			island, but not yet because I have a girlfriend’ or ‘Actually, no, maybe
			later, I can’t leave my mother’. My reason was that I didn’t want to
			share my books (laughs).</em></p>
			<p>The thought exercise that the island represents, though fictional,
			though idealised, is akin to what they attempted within their lives and
			practices. How do we imagine a new world outside of heteropatriarchy?
			How do we live our relationships, how do we create and maintain
			communities, how do we create together? A variety of responses and paths
			emerged. Many structures operated in non-hierarchical ways, the voices
			of every participant, no matter their level of education or involvement
			in the initiative, counted as much as the others. <em>We always tried to
			be ‘democratic’. At LOVER, all the decisions were made together, and we
			talked until everybody was on the same line.</em> Tasks were distributed
			among the women, who all worked in turn at different positions to
			prevent forms of dominance and hierarchy from appearing <sub>(Furter,
			2017, p.26).</sub> “Within De Bonte Was we shared intellectual and
			manual labour as fairly as possible: thinking and writing were expected
			of everyone, but mimeographing, packing, answering letters, visiting
			book fairs, giving interviews, etc., as well” <sub>(Ekelschot, 2005,
			sec. De Bonte Was, translation mine.)</sub>. The signatures are often
			collective, insisting on the collaborative aspect of the movement’s
			productions­—turning away from the traditional patterns of creation and
			notion of authorship <sub>(Furter, 2017, p.3)</sub>. This also acted as
			a protection, as some women wished to publish anonymously.

			<p>In 1985, Pamela’s student subsidies ended, and she started working at
			the University of Amsterdam. <em>I didn’t have time anymore, and it took
			a lot of time and work, all of this. So I stepped back, and many women
			did too.</em> The same year, De Bonte Was published their last book.
			From this time, she pursued a career; <em>I can’t separate my career and
			my activism; it began in women’s studies, which became gender studies,
			then I was in the literature department, and finally I stepped over to
			the film department. All that time gender was my main focus,</em> a pile
			of various books and publications, but also partnerships and life-long
			friendships; <em>many of my friends were in the movement, and my
			partners as well. We were doing everything together. It is very nice to
			have friends who share a similar life story, we don’t need to explain,
			we understand each other with half-words.</em></p>
